        <li>The DOCTYPE is not necessary but it tells the browser what type of HTML the file is written in. <br>
        This is the first thing on the file</li>
        <li>Then goes the html tag which puts everything together</li>
        <li>The head tag. Here goes the meta, style, script, title etc</li>
        <li>The body</li>
        <li>The Heading tags h1-6</li>
        <li>The Paragraph tag p</li>
        <li>To generate dummy text use type lorem and tab Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Quisquam vel nesciunt quas ipsam, similique repellendus cupiditate enim! Quaerat recusandae doloribus eligendi, officiis saepe reiciendis! Corrupti maxime perspiciatis ad voluptates optio.</li>
        <li>To generate a specific no of words use loremNo. and tab Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Natus at mollitia iure officiis sapiente possimus magnam ratione tenetur corporis saepe?</li>

        <li>Strong tag makes text bold</li>
        <li>Em tag makes text italic</li>
        <li>These two emphazise text</li>
        <li>a tag links a webpage to another file</li>
        <li>Attributes provide extra info to an element and are placed in start tags</li>
        <li>Key = "value"</li>
        <li>Then there are lists which can be ul and ol</li>
        <li>Then there are tables. It starts off with the table element and inside go the thead which is where the headings go, and then the tbody, which is where the actal content of the table goes</li>
        <li>tr means table row, th is table heading (bold) td is table cell of column which contains actual data</li>
        <li>Then there are forms which start with the form element and contain the action and method attributes</li>
        <li>Action="phpPage.php" and it sends the data there, and the method="get.post" will either retrieve data or send it to the file which will add it to the database and is safer</li>
        <li>Then there are labels in teh forms whicha re the First names and age labels</li>
        <li>Then the input tag is the input object.</li>
        <li>hr means horizontal rule which is used to separate items and is self closing. </li>

        <li>Then there are buttons which by default do nothing unless you use javascript</li>
        <li>Then there's img tag which sources and img and puts on the browser</li>
        <li>And if you put all images in the same folder coding the name.extension is enough but mostly all images are on another folder. Here you code folder/image.png. So if the broswer cant find the image, using the alt attribute will display the text</li>

        <li>meta tag defines about the metadata in an html document, meta tags
            always go inside the head tag .It is typically  used to specify 
            page description, character set, keywords, author of the document 
            and viewport settings. The information we store in the meta tag
            are not displayed directly in the website but are read by the bots
            of the browsers and using this our website will be positioned in 
            the search list of the search result.</li>
